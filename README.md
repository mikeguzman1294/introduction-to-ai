## What is expected for the Final Project

Short version : **Exploration of different AI approaches to play PyRat**

Long version : this course is mostly based on the final project, and you have a lot of freedom, which we expect you to use. The overarching goal is to explore different . 

We encourage students to get creative and test combinations of the various ideas that we present. Starting from the end of Session 4, you already have enough knowledge to explore different methods to be more efficent in playing PyRat. 

## Evaluation in this course 

First, have a look at the [evaluation sheet](evaluation.pdf).

There are **short written evaluations** during the first 10 minutes of **each** session starting from session 2. Don't be late!  

**For the final session**, we ask you to prepare a **15 minutes presentation**, that will be followed by 5 Minutes of question. 

What we expect for the presentations : 
1. Explain your strategy. We will judge whether you understood the goal, and whether the proposed strategy follows a rigourous approach.  
2. The clarity of your exposition and quality of your support (slides)

Importantly : We will NOT judge you based on your scores!
